# chime-frontend-project

### Introduction
Hello, thank you for considering Chime! We have designed this project-based interview to create a better interview experience for you; if you would prefer a traditional interview please let us know (this will have no impact on your interview). If this takes you longer than 4 hours please stop and send us what you have.

Out of respect for other candidates, please complete this project independently. You may use online resources but do not copy code.

You may use 3rd party libraries and use any online resources you would like.

### Description
Not every restaurant menu is the same. Depending on a menu's layout, customers can be more inclined to order fries for their table, or to not order at all. We handle a lot of menus and have our own menu interface - but we want to see how you choose to display a menu. For your project-based interview, you'll be tasked with fetching and displaying a menu from a (mock) server.

Create a webpage to display a restaurant's menu with the following guidelines
- Get the data from the remote URL and **for each** menu `category` in the response:
- Display the `category` and all `items` within it
- Display any `child categories` and the `items` in them

Reach goals:
- Make everything expandable and collapsible (interactivity)

The design is completely up to you. Think about the most logical way to display a menu with nested categories. There is a lot of extra data returned in this request that you can use if you want an extra challenge - try and display them in a meaningful way (ex. showing off featured or available items).

We also use semantic-ui-react, feel free to use it as well if you'd like a UI kit.

We've given you a minimal amount of starter code + the standard create-react-app boilerplate.

### Use this mock server URL:
GET: https://d5a5ce43-e7e0-44fc-9a4c-5158e9f33244.mock.pstmn.io/api/v1/menu (returns JSON)

### Next steps:
1. Clone this repo to your local computer to get started
2. Create a new repo with your finished project
3. Email a link to your project to eric@chimemenu.com
4. We'll be in touch shortly!
